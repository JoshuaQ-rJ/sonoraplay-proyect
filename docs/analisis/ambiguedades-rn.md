## Purpose

This document records the 10 business-rule ambiguities listed in section 7 of the project analysis. The instructor has not answered yet, so, as allowed by acceptance criterion 4 of EG-11, the team records an explicit working **Assumption** for each one so development is not blocked.

These assumptions are **not** instructor-approved requirements. When the instructor answers, the row is updated (answer, date, who answered) and every affected story, test, `config.py` value and ADR is updated in the same PR.

## Questions and working assumptions

### Q1 — RN-01: Continuous playback

**Question:** If a user pauses or interrupts a track before reaching 30 seconds, does the continuous-playback counter reset?

**Assumption:** Yes. The 30 seconds must be continuous. A pause, seek or interruption before reaching the threshold resets the count. A play is valid when one uninterrupted segment is ≥ 30 s (exactly 30 s is valid).

**Impact:** `src/sonoraplay/reglas/validez.py` (created in EG-17) and CA-01 tests (EG-17, To Do — its tests must cover "15 s + pause + 20 s = not valid"); Spark Silver layer (EG-35).

### Q2 — RN-03: Artist listener threshold

**Question:** Is the "< 1,000 listeners" count calculated daily, monthly or historically?

**Assumption:** Monthly unique listeners of the artist within the settlement month (UTC, see Q4), aligned with the monthly settlement. Signal 2 is therefore evaluated at month close, not in real time.

**Impact:** Fraud signal 2 in EG-18 and EG-36; window documented in ADR-0005.

### Q3 — RN-03: Scope of suspicious-account exclusion

**Question:** When an account is flagged as suspicious, are its streams excluded only for the affected day or for the entire settlement month?

**Assumption:** For the **entire settlement month** in which the account is flagged. All its streams that month are excluded from the pool and marked `under_review`. If the review clears the account, its streams are released as an **adjustment** in the next settlement (append-only, never overwriting a closed month).

**Why:** RN-03 says excluded streams "remain under review", which only makes sense if they can be paid later; and paying fraud by mistake is costlier for the labels than a delayed payment to a legitimate user. The false-positive cost is controlled by CA-10 (< 2%).

**Impact:** Exclusion period in `config.py` (EG-18, To Do — set the value to match this assumption when it is implemented); ADR-0005 (thresholds and period), ADR-0007 (adjustments), fraud report EG-43.

### Q4 — RN-02 / RN-04: Time zone

**Question:** Which time zone defines a "day" and a "month" for play limits and offline-stream attribution?

**Assumption:** UTC for every day and month boundary. RN-04 already states its cut-off in UTC ("day 2, 23:59 UTC"), so using UTC everywhere keeps the rules consistent.

**Impact:** Daily cap (EG-17), offline attribution (EG-22), F2 timestamps in UTC (EG-15). Decision recorded in **ADR-0002 — Accepted (2026-10-02)** (`docs/adr/0002-zona-horaria-dia-mes.md`).

### Q5 — RN-05: Net subscription revenue

**Question:** What deductions are included in "net subscription revenue"?

**Assumption:** Use the net amount stored in the F3 subscription source, before applying the 52% allocation. No taxes, store fees or commissions are invented unless the source provides them.

**Impact:** F3 must expose a net amount per payment (EG-13 — verify the column exists); pool function in EG-23 and EG-37.

### Q6 — RN-10: Family accounts across countries

**Question:** If members of the same family account stream from different countries, which country receives the subscription revenue?

**Assumption:** The **billing country** of the family account. For settlement, the valid streams of all members are also counted in the billing country's pool (numerator and denominator), so revenue and streams stay in the same pool. The stream country is kept only for consumption analytics and for RN-08 (territorial exclusions).

**Impact:** EG-23, EG-37; final decision in ADR-0008 (country that defines the pool).

### Q7 — RN-06: Contract percentage by territory

**Question:** Can the contractual royalty percentage vary by territory?

**Assumption:** The F4 model supports an optional territory on each contract condition. A territory-specific percentage is applied only when the contract explicitly defines one; otherwise the general percentage applies. Validity date (RN-07) and territorial exclusions (RN-08) still apply.

**Impact:** F4 seed and API (EG-14, EG-20), settlement join (EG-23).

### Q8 — Free plan and subscription denominator

**Question:** Do Free-plan streams enter the denominator used to distribute the subscription component of the pool?

**Assumption:** No. The pool is split into two components, each with its own denominator:

- **Subscription component** = 52% × net subscription revenue, distributed by valid streams from **paid plans** (individual, family, student).
- **Advertising component** = 45% × advertising revenue, distributed by valid streams from the **Free plan**.

Royalty per rights holder and country = sum of both components × contractual % (RN-06, RN-07). RNF-02 still holds: the sum per country never exceeds the pool (± 0.01 USD).

**Note:** this is a deviation from the literal single-pool formula in RN-05/RN-06. It is the assumption with the biggest money impact and the first one to confirm with the instructor.

**Impact:** settlement formula in EG-23 and EG-37; ADR-0008.

### Q9 — F1 duplicate tracks

**Question:** When F1 contains duplicate records, are they unified by `track_id`?

**Assumption:** Yes. The clean catalog has one canonical row per `track_id`; the different genres of the same track are kept as a list (or a bridge table), not as separate tracks, so plays are not split or double-counted. The detailed strategy and the number of removed/merged rows go in ADR-0003.

**Impact:** EG-12; ADR-0003.

### Q10 — AWS demo volume

**Question:** Must the final AWS demo process the full simulated volume of ~900,000 users, or may it use a representative subset?

**Assumption:** Development, testing and the AWS demo use a configurable subset (`--volume dev|full`). The seed must still be able to generate the full 900k volume locally. A full run on AWS depends on the budget and is decided in the cost analysis.

**Impact:** EG-28 (seed on RDS), EG-45 (full month on AWS), EG-32 (costs), E-14 demo.
